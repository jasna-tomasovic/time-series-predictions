This dataset was found on Kaggle.com. It contains detailed records of 776,527 bicycle journeys from the Transport for London (TfL) Cycle Hire system spanning from August 1 to August 31, 2023. The TfL Cycle Hire initiative provides publicly accessible bicycles for rent across London, promoting sustainable transportation and physical fitness.

This comprehensive dataset captures individual trip data, which can be utilized to analyze urban mobility patterns, station performance, and cycling preferences among London's diverse population. This dataset provides a snapshot of cycling activity during the month, including start and end details for each journey, the bicycle used, and the duration of hire.

I thought it would be interesting to check the actual locations of bike stations and include that in the analysis, so I researched and found stations' latitudes and longitudes online and then incorporated the data into the original dataset.

It would be interesting to include weather information here as well.
